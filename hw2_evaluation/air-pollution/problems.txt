no big difference in emissions from baseline to case 2 and case 3.
problem with case 2, is that in hbefa, anything under 30kmh is the same, so no change in emissions.
problem with case 3, is that in baseline network most of the primary and secondary links already have a low speed of 6.9 m/s or about 25 km/h, so our change to 30 km/h affects only very few links. Thus we see no effect of that policy.
